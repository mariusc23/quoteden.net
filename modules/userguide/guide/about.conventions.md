# Conventions

## Class Names and File Location

Class names in Kohana follow a strict convention to facilitate [autoloading](about.autoloading).

Class names should have uppercase first letters with underscores to separate words. Underscores are significant as they directly reflect the file location in the filesystem.

Class Name            | File Path
----------------------|-------------------------------
Controller_Template   | classes/controller/template.php
Model_User            | classes/model/user.php
Database              | classes/database.php
Database_Query        | classes/database/query.php

CamelCased classnames should not be used, except when it is undesirable to create a new directory level.

All class file names and directory names are lowercase.

All classes should be in the `classes` directory. This may be at any level in the [cascading filesystem](about.filesystem).

Kohana 3 does not differentiate between *types* of class in the same way that Kohana 2.x and some other frameworks do. There is no distinction between a 'helper' or a 'library' class â€“ in Kohana 3 any class can implement whatever interface you like whether it be entirely static (helper-like), or instantiable, or a mixture (e.g. singleton).

## Code Style

It is encouraged to follow Kohana's [coding style](http://dev.kohanaphp.com/wiki/kohana2/CodingStyle). This uses [BSD/Allman style](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#BSD.2FAllman_style) bracing, among other things.
